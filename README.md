- 👋 Hi, I’m @JimJamYay
- 👀 I’m interested in sci-fi, ASCII roguelikes, sports & automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, really. I've had a little experience with languages here & there, but it's safe to assume I know nothing concrete.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I'm interested in. I'm hoping to work on a conversion mod for CDDA.
